The list of things that I plan to do in the order I want to do them:

* Make file and directory structure useable, especially files should be next to the articles.
* A first image management: Images should be shrinked in size if bigger than a threshold value. And they should link to the full resolution image.

* Start building checks to ensure that content cannot break the blog. Start with
  * Every article must contain a title, date, template
  * ...or fill those fields with default and produce warnings.
* Structured the pages in portions easier to handle: default is composed of header, main and footer.
* Added pages as templates and build a simple _About_ and _Contact_ page.
