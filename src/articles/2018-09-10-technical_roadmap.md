The list of things that I plan to do in the order I want to do them:

* Start building checks to ensure that content cannot break the blog. Start with
  * Every article must contain a title, date, template
  * ...or fill those fields with default and produce warnings.
  * Make file and directory structure useable, especially files should be next to the articles.
